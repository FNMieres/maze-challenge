# Maze Challenge

This is a ReactJS application that solves a maze puzzle. The goal of this challenge is to build a component-based React application that allows an avatar to navigate through a maze until it finds an exit. Additionally, we'll use stores to keep track of the number of movements and send this data to a fictitious API endpoint when the maze is solved.

## Features

- Avatar that can navigate through the maze.
- Stores to manage game state, including the number of movements.
- Integration with a fictitious API endpoint to send game results.
- Creative and original UI design.
